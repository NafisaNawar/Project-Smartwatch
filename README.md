# Project-Smartwatch
This project presents an ESP32-based wearable smartwatch for real-time health and activity monitoring. It measures heart rate and SpO₂ using a pulse oximeter, tracks activity via an accelerometer, displays data on an OLED screen, and sends information to a smartphone for visualization.
